# Pull Request: Add Testing to CI Workflows

## Description

This PR adds automated testing to our CI/CD workflows:

- Adds unit and integration tests to PR validation workflow
- Updates test script commands for better organization
- Creates comprehensive testing documentation

## Changes

### Added
- E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md - Detailed documentation for e2e tests
- New npm scripts for test coverage and CI-specific testing

### Modified
- Updated PR validation workflow to run tests
- Updated TESTING_STATUS.md with CI integration info
- Enhanced README.md with testing documentation

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the test suite locally to verify all tests pass:
   ```
   npm run test:ci
   ```

2. Review the new testing documentation for accuracy

## Notes

The deploy.yml workflow should be updated to include tests but there's a formatting issue. This will need to be fixed separately by manually editing the file in GitHub.

### PR Checklist
- [x] Unit tests pass
