# Testing Status Report - Geome7ric Landing

## Overview

This document provides the current status of automated tests in the Geome7ric Landing project.

| Test Type | Status | Coverage | Issues |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Unit Tests | ✅ PASSING | 37/37 tests | None |
| Integration Tests | ✅ PASSING | 13/13 tests | None |
| E2E Tests | ⚠️ CONFIGURED | 9 tests | Unable to run due to disk space |

## Unit Tests

All unit tests are now passing. The `CalendlyModal` test was fixed by properly using React's `act` to wrap timer advances and accounting for all timing delays.

**Command to run:** `npm run test:unit`

## Integration Tests

All integration tests are now passing. Issues with mock hoisting were resolved in the integration tests for the API routes. The NextRequest/NextResponse polyfills were added to ensure proper mocking in the test environment.

**Command to run:** `npm run test:integration`

## E2E Tests (Playwright)

Playwright tests are properly configured but we're unable to run them due to disk space limitations. The tests are designed to test critical user flows.

### E2E Tests Status

| Test File | Tests | Status | Description |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| calendly-integration.spec.ts | 3 | ⚠️ UNTESTED | Tests for Calendly modal functionality |
| contact-form.spec.ts | 3 | ⚠️ UNTESTED | Tests for contact form submission |
| main-functionality.spec.ts | 5 | ⚠️ UNTESTED | Tests for core site functionality |

**Commands to run:**
- Full E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` 
- With UI: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- Headed mode: `npm run test:e2e:headed`

### E2E Test Requirements

- Node.js environment
- At least 500MB disk space for browser binaries
- Playwright dependencies (install with `npm run playwright:install`)

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage focuses on:

### Unit Tests
- Components behavior
- Hook functionality
- Utility functions

### Integration Tests
- API routes
- Email sending functionality
- Server-side data handling

### E2E Tests
- User flows
- Calendly integration
- Form submissions
- Responsive design

## CI/CD Integration

Tests have been integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **PR Validation:**
   - All unit and integration tests run on pull requests
   - PRs with failing tests will be blocked from merging

2. **Deployment:**
   - Unit and integration tests run before every deployment
   - Ensures only code with passing tests is deployed

## Next Steps

1. **E2E Test Execution:**
   - Free up disk space to run E2E tests
   - Validate E2E test results
   - Consider adding E2E tests to CI pipeline with selective runs

2. **Test Coverage Improvements:**
   - Increase unit test coverage for components
   - Add more integration tests for locale handling
   - Add visual regression tests

3. **CI Enhancement:**
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Add test status badges to README
