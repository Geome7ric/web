- Performance Optimization & Monitoring Deep Dive: Next.js Image Optimization Audit: Systematically review all image usage (many in assets) and ensure they are optimally loaded using the Next.js <Image> component to improve load times and Core Web Vital
- Sentry Custom Alerts: Leverage your Sentry setup (sentry.edge.config.ts, sentry.server.config.ts) by configuring custom performance alerts for key user flows or critical pages to proactively identify and address performance regressions.

- Accessibility (A11y) Overhaul:

Automated & Manual Audit: Implement an accessibility linting tool (e.g., eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) in your CI/CD pipeline. Conduct a manual audit focusing on:
Keyboard navigability for all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms, LanguageSwitcher.tsx, MobileHeader.tsx menu, PodcastPlayer.tsx controls).
Sufficient color contrast.
Correct ARIA attributes for dynamic components like modals and custom controls.
Ensuring all images, especially those in blogs, portfolio, and services, have meaningful and descriptive alt text.

- Advanced Contact & Lead Capture Mechanisms:

Service-Specific Inquiry Forms: For complex offerings detailed in Services.tsx (and data in data.ts), consider creating more detailed, multi-step inquiry forms to better qualify leads and gather specific requirements upfront.
Robust Contact API & CRM Integration: Ensure your contact form (likely in Contact.tsx) submits to a secure API endpoint (e.g., under src/app/[locale]/api/) with server-side validation. Integrate this endpoint with a CRM or a lead management tool for efficient follow-up.
Lead Magnets: Create valuable downloadable resources (e.g., a checklist for digital transformation, a guide to custom software benefits) offered in exchange for an email address. This can be integrated into relevant blog posts or service pages.
Interactive Service Exploration & Visualization:

- Dynamic Service Details: Enhance the Services.tsx component. Instead of static text, allow users to click on different facets of a service (e.g., for "Software a Medida," aspects like "Scalability," "Custom UI/UX," "Integrations") to reveal more detailed information, benefits, or directly link to relevant portfolio projects from data.ts.
  Visual Process Flows: For services that involve a distinct process (like your "How It Works" section, but potentially more detailed for specific services), use simple animations or interactive diagrams to illustrate the steps and benefits.
